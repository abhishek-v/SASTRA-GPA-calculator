SASTRA follows a really weird grading scale for calculating the GPA. As a result, our GPA appears lower than our peers in Anna university.
So, I created this script which converts your GPA in SASTRA into the Anna University equivalent.

Clone this repository into your local machine. Copy and paste the table in SASTRA's PWI into the gpa.txt file. The python script takes care of all the parsing..

Run the python file gpa2.py and this will display your CGPA based on Anna University's grading scale.

This GPA converter was designed for the batch of 2014, however you can tweak it to make it work for future batches as well by modifiying the "grades" dictionary in the python script.
